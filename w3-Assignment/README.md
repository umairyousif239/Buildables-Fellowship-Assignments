# W3 Assignment - Conversational Chatbot and Prompt Engineering

## Prerequisites
Please install all the libraries in the requirement.txt

## Project Details
This project is based on Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. It is a highly capable conversational model that has 3 different personas depending on whichever you wanna chose. The whole thing is executed through the web app built with streamlit library. 

## Usage
If you wish to run the chatbot, all you have to do is to open the terminal and type ```run streamlit run app.py``` and it will launch a web page in your browser. The UI is pretty simple, all you have to do is type in the prompt bar and it will answer the questions that you ask.

## 
All the custom prompts from me are in the ```datasets``` directory alongside the outputs from the LLM.
