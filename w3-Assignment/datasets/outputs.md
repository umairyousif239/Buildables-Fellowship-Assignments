    Q5:
    You: There are three boxes: one with apples, one with oranges, one mixed. All are mislabeled. You can take one fruit from one box. How do you correctly label all?
    Assistant: To correctly label the boxes, select a fruit from the box labeled "mixed." Based on the fruit you draw, you can deduce the contents of all the boxes:
    If you draw an apple: This box must contain only apples. Since all labels are wrong, the box labeled "oranges" cannot contain only oranges, nor can it contain only apples (as we've already identified that one). Therefore, the "oranges" box must be the mixed box. The remaining box labeled "apples" must contain only oranges.
    If you draw an orange: This box must contain only oranges. Since all labels are wrong, the box labeled "apples" cannot contain only apples, nor can it contain only oranges (as we've already identified that one). Therefore, the "apples" box must be the mixed box. The remaining box labeled "oranges" must contain only apples.

    Q6:
    You: If all Bloops are Razzies and all Razzies are Lazzies, are all Bloops definitely Lazzies?

    Q7:
    You: A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
    Assistant: The ball costs $0.05.
    Here's the breakdown:
    Let 'x' be the cost of the ball.
    The bat costs 'x + $1.00'.
    Together, they cost 'x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10'.
    Simplifying: '2x + $1.00 = $1.10'.
    '2x = $0.10'.
    'x = $0.05'.

    Q10:
    You: Q: A pen and a pencil cost $0.30 in total. The pen costs $0.20 more than the pencil.
    A: Let pencil = x. Then pen = x + 0.20. So x + (x+0.20) = 0.30 → 2x + 0.20 = 0.30 → 2x = 0.10 → x = $0.05.
    Q: A mug and a coaster cost $2.40 in total. The mug costs $1.20 more than the coaster.
    A: Let coaster = x. Then mug = x + 1.20. So x + (x+1.20) = 2.40 → 2x + 1.20 = 2.40 → 2x = 1.20 → x = $0.60.
    Q: A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
    Assistant: A: Let the ball = x. Then the bat = x + 1.00. Therefore, x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10 → 2x + 1.00 = 1.10 → 2x = 0.10 → x = $0.05.

    Q13:
    You: Q: A notebook and a pen cost $1.50 in total. The notebook costs $0.90 more than the pen.
    Step 1: Let pen = x → notebook = x + 0.90
    Step 2: x + (x + 0.90) = 1.50 → 2x + 0.90 = 1.50 → 2x = 0.60 → x = $0.30
    A: $0.30
    Q: A bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.
    (Show steps like above and then give final answer.)

    Assistant: Step 1: Let ball = x → bat = x + 1.00
    Step 2: x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10 → 2x + 1.00 = 1.10 → 2x = 0.10 → x = $0.05
    A: $0.05

    Q14: 
    You: Q: I’m tall when I’m young, and I’m short when I’m old. What am I?
