In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts [1] tried to understand how the brain could produce highly complex patterns by using interconnected basic cells, called neurons. The McCulloch and Pitts model of a neuron, called a MCP model, has made an important contribution to the development of artificial neural networks. A series of major contributions in the field is presented in Table 1, including LeNet [2] and Long Short-Term Memory [3], leading up to today's 'era of deep learning.' One of the most substantial breakthroughs in deep learning came in 2006, when Hinton et al. [4] introduced the Deep Belief Network, with multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines, greedily training one layer at a time in an unsupervised way. Guiding the training of intermediate levels of representation using unsupervised learning, performed locally at each level, was the main principle behind a series of developments that brought about the last decade's surge in deep architectures and deep learning algorithms.",

Furthermore, a significant disadvantage of DBNs is that they do not account for the two-dimensional structure of an input image, which may significantly affect their performance and applicability in computer vision and multimedia analysis problems. However, a later variation of the DBN, the Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN) ([42, 43]), uses the spatial information of neighboring pixels by introducing convolutional RBMs, thus producing a translation invariant generative model that successfully scales when it comes to high dimensional images, as is evidenced in [44].",

      "answer": "Based on the provided context:\n\n**(a) Discuss how CNNs are applied in object detection and face recognition tasks.**\nIn object detection, CNNs are commonly used to classify candidate windows. A typical approach involves creating a large set of candidate windows, extracting CNN features for each proposal, and then feeding these features to a classifier (like an SVM) to determine if the window contains an object. The concept of \"Regions with CNN features\" is a prominent paradigm in this area, often achieving good detection accuracies.\n\nThe provided text mentions \"face recognition\" as a key computer vision task that deep learning algorithms contribute to, but it does not describe *how* CNNs are applied in face recognition tasks within this specific context.\n\n**(b) What are some key differences between holistic and part-based methods in human pose estimation?**\nThe key differences are:\n*   **Processing Approach:** Holistic methods process input images in a global fashion, aiming to accomplish the task without explicitly defining models for individual body parts or their spatial relationships. Part-based methods, conversely, focus on detecting individual human body parts first.\n*   **Model Definition:** Holistic methods, like DeepPose, formulate human pose estimation as a joint regression problem and do not explicitly define graphical models or part detectors. Part-based methods, however, typically follow the individual part detection with a graphic model to incorporate spatial information and relationships between parts.\n*   **Accuracy:** Holistic methods tend to suffer from inaccuracy in high-precision regions due to the difficulty in directly regressing complex pose vectors from images. Part-based methods aim to overcome this by focusing on individual parts and then integrating them with spatial models.\n*   **Training Strategy (Examples):** Holistic methods might train a network using the whole image for joint regression. Part-based methods might train multiple smaller CNNs for independent binary body-part classification, use local part patches, or design multiresolution CNNs for heat-map likelihood regression for each body part.\n\n**(c) How have multimodal approaches improved performance in human activity recognition?**\nThe provided context mentions \"action/activity recognition\" as a computer vision task, but it does not contain any information regarding multimodal approaches or how they have improved performance in human activity recognition.",

DeepPose [14] is a holistic model that formulates the human pose estimation method as a joint regression problem and does not explicitly define the graphical model or part detectors for the human pose estimation.

Object detection is the process of detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, airplanes, or birds) in digital images and video (Figure 4). A common approach for object detection frameworks includes the creation of a large set of candidate windows that are in the sequel classified using CNN features. For example, the method described in [32] employs selective search [60] to derive object proposals, extracts CNN features for each proposal, and then feeds the features to an SVM classifier to decide whether the windows include the object or not. A large number of works is based on the concept of Regions with CNN features proposed in [32]. Approaches following the Regions with CNN paradigm usually have good detection accuracies (e.g., [61, 62]); however, there is a significant number of methods trying to further improve the performance of Regions with CNN approaches, some of which succeed in finding approximate object positions but often cannot precisely determine the exact position of the object [63]. To this end, such methods often follow a joint object detection-semantic segmentation approach [64-66], usually attaining good results.",
