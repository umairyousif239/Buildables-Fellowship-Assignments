# Project 2: Multimodal AI Application

## Objective
Create an application that uses vision-enabled LLMs (Gemini Pro Vision or GPT-4o) to analyze images and process long-context documents.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1.  **Image Analysis (Multiple Types)**
    *   Test on at least 3 different image types:
        *   Photograph: Describe and analyze a photo
        *   Document/Screenshot: Extract and structure text (OCR)
        *   Chart/Diagram: Interpret visual data or diagrams
2.  **Long-Context Processing**
    *   Process a document with 50,000+ tokens
    *   Ask at least 3 multi-part questions
    *   Test the model's context understanding
3.  **Practical Use Case**
    *   Demonstrate one real-world application, such as:
        *   Document scanner + Q&A system
        *   Image-based information extraction
        *   Visual content moderation
        *   Accessibility tool (describe images for visually impaired)
        *   Any other creative use case
