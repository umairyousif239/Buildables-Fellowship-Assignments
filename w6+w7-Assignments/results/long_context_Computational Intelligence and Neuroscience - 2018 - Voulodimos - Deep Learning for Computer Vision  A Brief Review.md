    *   **2.2. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) & Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs)**
        *   **2.2.1. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) Foundation:**
            *   **Type:** Generative stochastic neural network, undirected graphical model.
            *   **Structure:** Bipartite graph with stochastic visible (v) and hidden (h) variables (no intra-layer connections).
            *   **Training:** Efficiently trained using gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.
            *   **Mathematical:** Defined by an energy function E(v, h; θ) and joint distribution P(v, h; θ) with parameters θ (symmetric interaction terms W, bias terms a, b).
        *   **2.2.2. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs):**
            *   **Nature:** Probabilistic generative models, formed by stacking RBMs.
            *   **Structure:** Top two layers form an undirected RBM, lower layers have directed, top-down connections.
            *   **Training:**
                1.  **Greedy Layer-wise Unsupervised Pre-training:** Each layer trained as an RBM, using output from previous layer as input.
                2.  **Fine-tuning:** All weights jointly optimized using a proxy for DBN log-likelihood or a supervised criterion (often with an added classifier).
            *   **Advantages:** Addresses parameter selection, prevents poor local optima, ensures appropriate network initialization.
            *   **Disadvantages:** High computational training cost, unclear maximum likelihood optimization, inability to account for 2D image structure (limiting for computer vision).
            *   **Variation:** Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN) uses convolutional RBMs to incorporate spatial information, producing translation-invariant models.
        *   **2.2.3. Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs):**
            *   **Structure:** Multiple hidden layers with **all undirected connections**. Units in odd-numbered layers are conditionally independent of units in even-numbered layers.
            *   **Inference:** Generally intractable.
            *   **Training:** Initially joint training with Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) (prone to poor local minima); improved by greedy layer-wise pretraining (stacking/training RBMs) followed by joint fine-tuning.
            *   **Advantages:** Capture complex multi-layered representations, suitable for unsupervised learning, can be finetuned for supervised tasks. Unique approximate inference includes bottom-up and top-down feedback, effectively incorporating uncertainty. Allows joint optimization of all layer parameters for heterogeneous data.

            *   **Function:** Trained to encode input `x` into a representation `r(x)` such that `x` can be reconstructed from `r(x)`. Target output is the input itself.
            *   **Representation `r(x)`:** Learned feature, aims to capture main data variations (similar to PCA but can be nonlinear).
            *   **Objective:** Minimize reconstruction error (e.g., squared error, cross-entropy).
            *   **Hidden Layers:** Linear layers behave like PCA; nonlinear layers capture multimodal aspects.

            *   **Type:** Stochastic version of autoencoder.
            *   **Mechanism:** Input is stochastically corrupted, but the uncorrupted input is used as the reconstruction target.
            *   **Functions:** Encodes input, undoes corruption by capturing statistical dependencies.
            *   **Theoretical Link:** Maximizes a lower bound on the log-likelihood of a generative model.
            *   **Significance:** Demonstrated successful unsupervised pretraining and linked to generative models.
        *   **2.3.3. Stacked (Denoising) Autoencoders (SDAEs):**
            *   **Structure:** Formed by stacking denoising autoencoders, where the latent representation of a lower layer serves as input for the subsequent layer.
            *   **Training:**
                1.  **Unsupervised Pretraining:** One layer at a time, minimizing reconstruction error of its input.
                2.  **Supervised Fine-tuning:** After pretraining, a logistic regression layer is added to the final output. The entire network (encoding parts only) is then trained like a multilayer perceptron, considering the target class.
    *   **2.4. Model Comparisons & Characteristics:**
        *   **SDAEs:** Flexible layer parametrization, not generative (cannot draw samples), can sometimes outperform DBNs, can work unsupervised, real-time training possible.
        *   **DBNs:** Generative, often outperform SAs and other models for non-visual input, high computational cost, generally outperformed by CNNs on computer vision benchmarks.
        *   **CNNs:** Automatic feature learning (no handcrafted features), invariant to transformations (translation, scale, rotation), generally outperform DBNs on computer vision tasks, but rely on labeled ground truth data, time-consuming training.
        *   **Autoencoders (General):** Can be ineffective if initial errors lead to reconstructing the average of training data.
        *   **Denoising Autoencoders:** Mitigate general autoencoder issues by learning to retrieve correct input from corrupted versions, grasping input distribution structure.

### Q: (a) Discuss how CNNs are applied in object detection and face recognition tasks. (b) What are some key differences between holistic and part-based methods in human pose estimation? (c) How have multimodal approaches improved performance in human activity recognition?

Here's a breakdown of the answers based on the provided context:

**(a) Discuss how CNNs are applied in object detection and face recognition tasks.**
In object detection, CNNs are commonly applied by first creating a large set of candidate windows. CNN features are then extracted from these windows and fed into a classifier (such as an SVM) to determine if the windows contain the target object. Many approaches are based on the concept of "Regions with CNN features," where CNNs are used to process object proposals and classify them.

The provided text mentions "face recognition" as a key computer vision task where deep learning algorithms contribute, but it **does not provide details** on how CNNs are specifically applied in face recognition tasks.

**(b) What are some key differences between holistic and part-based methods in human pose estimation?**
The key differences are:

*   **Processing Approach:**
    *   **Holistic methods** process input images in a global fashion, attempting to accomplish the task without explicitly defining models for individual body parts or their spatial relationships.
    *   **Part-based methods** focus on detecting individual human body parts first, and then use a graphic model to incorporate spatial information among these parts.
*   **Model Definition:**
    *   **Holistic methods** (e.g., DeepPose) formulate human pose estimation as a joint regression problem and do not explicitly define graphical models or part detectors.
    *   **Part-based methods** explicitly detect parts and then use models (like graphic models or weak spatial models) to understand their relationships and ensure consistency.
*   **Accuracy:**
    *   **Holistic methods** tend to be less accurate in high-precision regions due to the difficulty in directly learning complex pose vectors from images.
    *   **Part-based methods** aim to improve accuracy by breaking down the problem into detecting individual parts and then assembling them with spatial constraints.

**(c) How have multimodal approaches improved performance in human activity recognition?**
The provided text mentions "action/activity recognition" as a key computer vision task, but it **does not provide any information** on multimodal approaches or how they have improved performance in this area.
