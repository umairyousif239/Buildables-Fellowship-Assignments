    *   **Architecture:**
        *   **Convolutional Layers:** "Trainable filters" generating feature maps.
        *   **Pooling Layers:** Reduce spatial dimensions, decrease overhead, prevent overfitting (e.g., Max Pooling for faster convergence, invariant features).
        *   **Fully Connected Layers:** High-level reasoning, transform 2D feature maps to 1D feature vector.
    *   **Training:**
        *   **Challenge:** Overfitting due to many parameters.
        *   **Solutions:** Stochastic Pooling, Dropout, Data Augmentation, Pretraining.
    *   **Strengths:** Automatic feature learning, invariance to transformations (translation, scale, rotation).
    *   **Limitations:** Relies heavily on labeled data, computationally demanding and time-consuming training.
*   **B. Boltzmann Family (Deep Belief Networks - DBNs & Deep Boltzmann Machines - DBMs)**
    *   **Core Building Block:** Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) – generative stochastic neural network, undirected bipartite graph (efficient training via contrastive divergence).
    *   **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs):**
        *   **Nature:** Probabilistic generative, graphical models.
        *   **Structure:** Stacked RBMs; top two layers undirected, lower layers directed.
        *   **Training:** Greedy, layer-by-layer unsupervised pretraining, followed by joint fine-tuning (supervised or proxy for log-likelihood).
        *   **Strengths:** Generative models, good for non-visual input.
        *   **Limitations:** High computational cost, limited 2D image structure accounting (addressed by CDBNs).
    *   **Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (CDBNs):** Variation of DBNs using convolutional RBMs to incorporate spatial information, yielding translation-invariant generative models.
    *   **Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs):**
        *   **Structure:** Multiple hidden layers, **all connections undirected** (unlike DBNs). Odd/even layers conditionally independent.
        *   **Inference:** Generally intractable, but approximate inference includes bottom-up and top-down feedback.
        *   **Training:** Greedy layer-wise pretraining (stacking RBMs) followed by joint fine-tuning (unsupervised or supervised).

        *   **Limitations:** High computational cost of inference, time-consuming training.
*   **C. Stacked (Denoising) Autoencoders (SDAEs)**
    *   **Core Building Block:** Autoencoder – maps input `x` to representation `r(x)` to reconstruct `x`. Optimizes reconstruction error.
    *   **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE):** Stochastic version; input corrupted, uncorrupted input is reconstruction target. Encodes input, undoes corruption, captures statistical dependencies. Maximizes lower bound on generative model log-likelihood.
    *   **Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAEs):** Deep network of stacked DAEs.
        *   **Training:**
            1.  **Unsupervised Pretraining:** Layer-by-layer, each DAE minimizes reconstruction error of latent representation from layer below.
            2.  **Supervised Fine-tuning:** Logistic regression layer added; optimize prediction error on supervised task (as MLP, using only encoding parts).
        *   **Strengths:** Can work unsupervised, real-time training possible.
        *   **Limitations:** Not a generative model, generally outperformed by DBNs/CNNs on CV benchmarks.

### Q: What are potential limitations or risks, and how might they be mitigated?

Based on the context provided, here are the potential limitations or risks and how some might be mitigated:

**Limitations/Risks:**

    *   Difficulty in accurately estimating joint probabilities.
    *   High computational cost in their creation.
2.  **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
    *   Reliance on the availability of ground truth (labelled training data).
3.  **General Autoencoders:**
    *   Could become ineffective if errors are present in the first layers, potentially causing the network to learn to reconstruct only the average of the training data.
4.  **Pooling Layers (in CNNs):**
    *   The reduction of spatial dimensions leads to a simultaneous loss of information.

**Mitigation:**

1.  **For general Autoencoders:**
    *   **Mitigation:** **Denoising autoencoders** can address the issue of errors. They are designed to handle stochastically corrupted input and learn to reconstruct the uncorrupted input, thereby capturing statistical dependencies and being more robust to errors.
2.  **For Pooling Layers:**
    *   **Mitigation/Benefit:** While pooling layers cause a loss of information, this loss is considered **beneficial** for the network. It leads to less computational overhead for subsequent layers and helps to prevent overfitting.
