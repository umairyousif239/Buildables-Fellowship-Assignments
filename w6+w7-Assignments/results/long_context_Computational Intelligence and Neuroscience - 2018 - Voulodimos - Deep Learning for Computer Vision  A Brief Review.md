Here are the answers based on the provided context:

(a) The main factors that contributed to the rise of deep learning in recent years include:
*   The appearance of large, high-quality, publicly available labeled datasets.
*   The empowerment of parallel GPU computing.
*   The alleviation of the vanishing gradient problem due to the disengagement from saturating activation functions.

(b) GPU computing and large labeled datasets have significantly influenced the performance of deep learning models by:
*   **GPU computing:** It enabled the transition from CPU-based to GPU-based training, which allowed for significant acceleration in the training of deep models.
*   **Large labeled datasets:** Their availability provided the necessary data for deep learning models to learn effectively and achieve high performance.

(c) New activation functions played a role in improving neural networks by alleviating the vanishing gradient problem. This was achieved through the disengagement from saturating activation functions like hyperbolic tangent and the logistic function. The provided text does not mention the role of regularization techniques in improving neural networks.

### Q: (a) Describe the structure and functioning of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). (b) Compare CNNs with Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) in terms of learning approach and efficiency. (c) What are the main advantages and limitations of Stacked Autoencoders compared to the other two architectures?

Here's a breakdown of the requested information based on the provided context:

**(a) Describe the structure and functioning of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).**
The provided text offers limited detail on the internal structure and functioning of CNNs. It states that a major positive aspect of CNNs is 'feature learning,' meaning they automatically learn features, bypassing the need for handcrafted features required by other network types. CNNs also rely on the availability of ground truth, i.e., labeled training data.

**(b) Compare CNNs with Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) in terms of learning approach and efficiency.**

*   **Learning Approach:**
    *   **CNNs:** Rely on labeled training data (supervised learning) and automatically learn features.
    *   **DBNs/DBMs:** Can work in an unsupervised manner, meaning they do not require labeled data. They utilize the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) as their learning module. DBNs employ a greedy learning process.
*   **Efficiency and Performance:**
    *   **CNNs:** Have generally performed better than DBNs on benchmark computer vision datasets like MNIST.
    *   **DBNs/DBMs:** DBNs often outperform other models when the input is nonvisual. However, DBNs suffer from high computational cost during training and difficulty in accurately estimating joint probabilities. A significant disadvantage of DBNs is their inability to account for the two-dimensional structure of an input image, which can affect their performance in computer vision. A variation, the Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN), addresses this by using convolutional RBMs to handle spatial information and scale to high-dimensional images.

**(c) What are the main advantages and limitations of Stacked Autoencoders compared to the other two architectures?**

*   **Advantages of Stacked Autoencoders (SAs):**
    *   Similar to DBNs/DBMs, SAs can work in an unsupervised manner, not requiring labeled training data (unlike CNNs).
    *   The principle for training SAs is similar to DBNs, using autoencoders instead of Restricted Boltzmann Machines.
    *   Stacked Denoising Autoencoders, a variation, can sometimes outperform Deep Belief Networks.
*   **Limitations of Stacked Autoencoders (SAs):**
    *   Deep Belief Networks generally tend to outperform standard stacked autoencoders, though this is not always the case, especially when comparing DBNs to Stacked Denoising Autoencoders.
    *   A disadvantage of autoencoders (and thus SAs) is that they can become ineffective if errors are present in the first layers, potentially causing the network to learn to reconstruct only the average of the training data.

### Q: (a) Discuss how CNNs are applied in object detection and face recognition tasks. (b) What are some key differences between holistic and part-based methods in human pose estimation? (c) How have multimodal approaches improved performance in human activity recognition?

Based on the provided context:

**(a) Discuss how CNNs are applied in object detection and face recognition tasks.**
In object detection, CNNs are commonly used to classify candidate windows. A typical approach involves creating a large set of candidate windows, extracting CNN features for each proposal, and then feeding these features to a classifier (like an SVM) to determine if the window contains an object. The concept of "Regions with CNN features" is a prominent paradigm in this area, often achieving good detection accuracies.

The provided text mentions "face recognition" as a key computer vision task that deep learning algorithms contribute to, but it does not describe *how* CNNs are applied in face recognition tasks within this specific context.

**(b) What are some key differences between holistic and part-based methods in human pose estimation?**
The key differences are:
*   **Processing Approach:** Holistic methods process input images in a global fashion, aiming to accomplish the task without explicitly defining models for individual body parts or their spatial relationships. Part-based methods, conversely, focus on detecting individual human body parts first.
*   **Model Definition:** Holistic methods, like DeepPose, formulate human pose estimation as a joint regression problem and do not explicitly define graphical models or part detectors. Part-based methods, however, typically follow the individual part detection with a graphic model to incorporate spatial information and relationships between parts.
*   **Accuracy:** Holistic methods tend to suffer from inaccuracy in high-precision regions due to the difficulty in directly regressing complex pose vectors from images. Part-based methods aim to overcome this by focusing on individual parts and then integrating them with spatial models.
*   **Training Strategy (Examples):** Holistic methods might train a network using the whole image for joint regression. Part-based methods might train multiple smaller CNNs for independent binary body-part classification, use local part patches, or design multiresolution CNNs for heat-map likelihood regression for each body part.

**(c) How have multimodal approaches improved performance in human activity recognition?**
The provided context mentions "action/activity recognition" as a computer vision task, but it does not contain any information regarding multimodal approaches or how they have improved performance in human activity recognition.
