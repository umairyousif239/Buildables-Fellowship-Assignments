        "Project Abstract",
        "Traditional CCTV surveillance systems have grown to be a necessity for all types of businesses. Whether it's a big-name corporation, or a house owner, everyone has come to have a need for these surveillance  systems.  However,  the  problem  with  these  systems  these  days  is  that  with  each passing day, they are growing more and more obsolete.",
        "To solve that problem, we came up with this project. This project acts as an upgrade to the preexisting  surveillance  systems,  it  utilizes  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  to  further enhance the capabilities of the currently installed surveillance systems. Additionally, this model will be hosted on a locally installed Raspberry Pi to process and store all the data locally without any access to the third-party company for storage or processing of all the footage.",
        "1 Introduction",
        "This  project  works  upon  the  pre-existing  technology  such  as  an  already  installed  surveillance systems at a home, a school or a corporation. What this project aims to achieve is to further enhance their capabilities of threat and facial recognition, smoke and fire detection.",
        "All the readily available products in the consumer market always lack something to make the surveillance system truly AI-capable. Additionally, all the available products have no guarantee of personal privacy as it sends the user data back to the company's servers. What this project aims to do is give the users all the control of their own data and have all the processing happen locally. We aim to further enhance the facial recognition capabilities through machine learning algorithms which would boost the accuracy by a lot. Furthermore, the final model will also be enhanced to be able to detect fire, smoke and threats easily with a high accuracy rate. And the proposed system will also have a low latency of alert notifications.",
        "2 Success Criterion",
        "For this project to be a success we will make sure that the project is rigorously trained to have a proper understanding of all the threats and problems that this project aims to solve. It will be trained on multiple datasets to have a wide range of understanding and the trained model will also be made to be a lightweight model that can be run on a Raspberry Pi.",
        "The success of the proposed system will be measured by:",
        "Accuracy: ≥ 85% detection accuracy across selected scenarios (weapons, intruders, fire, fights).",
        "Latency: ≤ 2 seconds between incident occurrence and alert notification.",
        "Scalability: Ability to handle multiple camera feeds simultaneously.",
        "Usability: Mobile dashboard that is user-friendly and provides real-time alerts.",
        "Reliability: System  must  perform  consistently  under  different  lighting  and  environmental conditions.",
        "3 Related work",
        "Currently, there are a lot of products that act similar to this project. However, they are quite limited in terms of detecting threats or dangerous situations. If there is a system that can detect intruders and weapons, it doesn't detect fire and smoke properly. Below are some products that are similar to our proposed project.",
        "ZeroEyes",
        "Overview: AI system focused on detecting firearms via existing surveillance cameras. Widely used in schools and supported by grant programs like in Kansas.",
        "Limitations:",
        "o Extremely specific legislative criteria may disadvantage competitors.",
        "o Expensive deployment-up to ~$929,000 for pilot programs.",
        "o Funding directed here may divert from other critical safety needs.",

        "Overview:  Transforms  IP/CCTV  into  real-time  weapon  detection  systems.  Reports  up  to  92% accuracy and 50% faster response in case studies.",
        "Limitations:",
        "o Focuses on weapons only; does not include fire or fight detection.",
        "o Presumed need for fine-tuning-initial performance may suffer in varied environments.",

        "Overview: Smart gun detection system that integrates with existing camera networks, turning them into firearm-detecting smart cameras.",
        "Limitations:",
        "o Limited publicly available information on accuracy and performance benchmarks.",
        "4 Project Rationale",
        "In current landscape of the world, security and privacy are becoming a major concern in our day to day life. Because  of  that,  even  an  ordinary  person  has  surveillance  cameras  installed  at  their  house  in  case  of emergencies. However, surveillance cameras currently are severely lacking some necessary features that would make their use-case a whole lot more impactful.",
        "An automated surveillance system would eliminate the need to manually check the cameras for any cause of concern, or have someone stand watch on the cameras. If something were to happen, it would just send you an alert through its app that notify you regarding the current cause of concern.",
        "Additionally, this project would help us learn and understand more about how artificial intelligence models work, especially when they're processing visuals. It would also teach us more about how models are trained using large datasets in order to increase their accuracy and efficiency.",
